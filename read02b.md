# Git  & GitHub
 **it's mean stores tha data in file system made up of snapshot. it mean when we commit the changes the git will creates a snapshot of the file** .
**the git relies on local operation system  .So we can see a history on the local disk also the file in git have 3 main states: committed, modified and staged**. 

 **First of all we need to install the last version of  git in our pc and os if it windows , linux, MAC.**
**after installion it in local pc we can importing and cloning by command line**.

**GitHub** : *a place where we can share our code (on the cloud) and see others' code, we don't have it on our local machine (online)*
**Git** : *version control system, it's on our local machine, we can see our files, what changes are made, why they are made and by who, the most popular commands using* *Git are: ACP add-commit-push*
**VS Code**: *Code editor, we write our code in VS Code*

###### When to use git pull origin main:question:
*When you did changes on repo on GitHub (Don't do this)* *always have your changes done on VS Code, but sometimes you will have changes made on GitHub that you maybe forgot about*
**What to do:**
-*On the terminal, write the command git pull origin main, to make sure that the changes made on GitHub are also on your local machine (locally on your VS Code), and then you will see some process happening which is adding the new changes locally*
**You can also notice this problem when you do A-C-P you will see a message on the terminal kinda like this " use 'git pull ...'**
**then you simply add this command and close the message tab in the VS Code*]**
