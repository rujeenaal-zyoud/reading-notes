# tree 

**A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures**
## Common Terminology
Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf


### Binary seach tree 
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

**We have two methode enqueue ,dequeue**


## K-ary Trees
If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.
