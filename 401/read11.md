# Stack & Queue 

### what the stack ?

*A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.*


### Stacks follow these concepts:

* FILO
First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

* LIFO
Last In First Out

This means that the last item

**push and pop**
**Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.**





## what is queue ?


**A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.**
