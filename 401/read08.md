# Bearer Authorization


#### Write the following steps in the correct order:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret.
2.  Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
3. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
4. Receive authorization code
5. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
6. Receive access token
7. Make a request to the access token endpoint.
------------------------------------------------------------

### What can you do with an authorization code?
--------------------------------------------------------------
*The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request.*

### What can you do with an access token?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*An access token is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity.*

### What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

*Better security.*
------------------------------------------------------------
## Terms
* **Client ID**: The client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it's public, it's best that it isn't guessable by third parties, so many implementations use something like a 32-character hex string. It must also be unique across all clients that the authorization server handles.

* **Client secret**: is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. Protect your client secrets and never include them in mobile or browser-based apps.

* **Authentication endpoint**: where the user is sent to input credentials to become authorized Access Token 

* **Endpoint**: where apps make a request to get an access token for a user

* **API Endpoint**: can include a URL of a server or service, each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function

* **Authorization Code**: temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token

*  **Access token:** is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity.

## Preparation Materials
=============================================================

**JSON Web Token (JWT)**:
*is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.*

*Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.*

#### Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:
=============================================================

**Authorization:** This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

**Information Exchange**: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.
========================================================

**How do JSON Web Tokens work?**
 *In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to prevent security issues. In general, you should not keep tokens longer than required.*

*You also should not store sensitive session data in browser storage due to lack of security.*

*Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT, typically in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema. The content of the header should look like the following: Authorization: Bearer <token>*

*This can be, in certain cases, a stateless authorization mechanism. The server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header, and if it's present, the user will be allowed to access protected resources. If the JWT contains the necessary data, the need to query the database for certain operations may be reduced, though this may not always be the case.*

*If the token is sent in the Authorization header, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) won't be an issue as it doesn't use cookies.*

*As JSON is less verbose than XML, when it is encoded its size is also smaller, making JWT more compact than SAML. This makes JWT a good choice to be passed in HTML and HTTP environments.*

*Security-wise, SWT can only be symmetrically signed by a shared secret using the HMAC algorithm. However, JWT and SAML tokens can use a public/private key pair in the form of a X.509 certificate for signing. Signing XML with XML Digital Signature without introducing obscure security holes is very difficult when compared to the simplicity of signing JSON.*

*JSON parsers are common in most programming languages because they map directly to objects. Conversely, XML doesn't have a natural document-to-object mapping. This makes it easier to work with JWT than SAML assertions.*

*JWTs can be either signed, encrypted or both. If a token is signed, but not encrypted, everyone can read its contents, but when you don't know the private key, you can't change it. Otherwise, the receiver will notice that the signature won't match anymore.*
