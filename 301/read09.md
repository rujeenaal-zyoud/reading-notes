# Functional Programming
#### QUESTIONS OF FUNCTIONAL
**1- What is functional programming?**
its a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.
 **2- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**
  the function is pure when it returns the same result if given the same arguments, and does not cause any observable side effects.
  **3- What are the benefits of a pure function?**
   The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything.

**4- What is immutability?**

Immutability means value Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

**5- What is Referential transparency?**

A function is considered a referentially transparent when we can replace it with a constant value.

**6- What is a module?**
 A module is another JavaScript file.

**7- What does the word ‘require’ do?**
 we use it so we can use global functions from other files. 
**8- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**
 using require and passing to it the path of the file we want.

**9- What do we have to do to make a module available?**

we have to export the parts we want to use in another file by using module.exports, then we have to assign it to a variable in the other file.

###### A programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
-----------------------------------
 ##### Pure Functions
 
> returns the same result if given the same arguments aka deterministic
> does not cause observable side effects
> Reading Files is not pure because the file’s content can change
-------------------------------------------
 ##### Benefits of Pure Functions
**code becomes easier to test**
------------------------------------------------
### Immutability

**Immutability means value Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.**

> **When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.**
> **If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.**
------------------------------------------------------------
 ### Referential transparency

**A function is considered a referentially transparent when we can replace it with a constant value. So, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.**
--------------------------------------------
### Functions as first-class entities

**The idea is to treat functions as values and pass functions like data. This way we can combine different functions to create new functions with new behavior.**
---------------------------
#####  Higher-order functions
A higher-order functions are functions that either:

- takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- returns a function as its result.
