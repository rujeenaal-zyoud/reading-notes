#### Thinking in React
**React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.**
###### Notes:
_One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them_

*In this document, we’ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React*.

#### Build A Static Version in React
- **To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props.**
 - **props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version.**
 - **State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.**

 ###### entify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
- **To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs.** 

-**The key here is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself.the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:**
*The original list of products The search text the user has entered The value of the checkbox The filtered list of products*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### For each piece of state in your application:
 1- *Identify every component that renders something based on that state.*
 2- *Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).*
 
 3- *Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.*
