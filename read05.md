# Comparison and logical operators .
##### Function & methods & objects .
 **In JS we need functions and some opertor to make the code more easy**
 - **Function**: it's group of set statement together that represent a single task.
 - The function have : 
  *parameters* : It's information required to do the job and it may return a value from the function opertor.
  -**Object**: the variables in JS it's properties of object .
  ###### The web implement objects that mean document loaded and browser window.

  **The JS have built-in object and function like: String, Number ,Math,and Date**.

  ## CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
  *The condition it mean how to take the decision in ordere to what the expression that we have (by returns a value) and what to do in given situation*.
**Operators**
  1*We evaluating the condation by operators such as*:
  1-(==) is equal to
  2- (!=) is not equal to
  3-(===) strict equal to
  4-(!==)  strict not equal to
  5-(>) greater than
  6-(<) less than 
  7-(>=) greater than or equal
  8-(<=) less than  or equal


  2*Logical operators*
  *it mean how we can comparison the statment*
  1-(&&) logical and 
  2-(||) logical or
  3(!) logical not
