## Layout
**A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer**
**By using css we can position the element in HTML  and using float propertyby using 3 positing schemes**
-normal flow:*that mean each element will appears on new line*
-relative positioning:*Shift the element to left or right or top,bottom,*
-absolute positioning:*it mean like normal but with scroll up and down*
**By using the float to place elements in page if we float item to left and the anthor item right it will appeare side-by-side we have 4type for float**
-*left*
-*right*
-*both*
-*none*
**In our web page we need to determine  the size of website to fit the screen because it is important to  display the resolutions that in css by using layout also we can use fixed width layouts all of this by grid**
**CSS Frameworks**:*the framework  it's code in css  provide rules for common tasks so it make life easier*
