# CSS 
###### Transforms
**In css there is alot of ways to position the elements and change the element by using transform property**
**IN TRANSFORMS PROPERTY WITH two different settings**
1-two-dimensional.
2- three-dimensional.

**2D Transforms**: The 2D work with x and y axes 
**3D Transforms**: The 3D work with x and y,z axes by using scale 
**2D Rotate** : The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees by using rotate
**2D Skew** : skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both by using skewX, skewY,skew
**Perspective**:the perspective value within the transform property works great for transforming one element from a single, unique perspective
---------------------------------------------------------------
###### Transitions & Animations
**Transitions**:an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. in transitions we have 4 states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes. 

*There are four transition related properties  in CSS tagetransition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition*



*CSS3 has introduced countless possibilities for UX designers, and the best thing about them is that the coolest parts are really simple to implement by using HTML tage all of hese effects (bar one) are controlled with the transition property*.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Animations**: an Animation mean we want more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off from CSS by using  *@keyframes rule*. and &*animation-name*:to put the name  after it we put *animation-duration* : it mean how long time the animations.
*animation-iteration-count*: To have an animation repeat itself numerous times
