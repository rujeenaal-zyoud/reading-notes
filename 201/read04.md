###### links.
**in HTML we can create the links to move from**
-*page to another page in same website*
- *from our website to anthor website*
-*link to address by email*
**Al of the links write in same tage <a></a> put diffrenet in herf put the url that we want and in email links we use "mailto"in herf**
###### Layout.
**By using css we can position the element in HTML  and using float propertyby using 3 positing schemes**
-normal flow:*that mean each element will appears on new line*
-relative positioning:*Shift the element to left or right or top,bottom,*
-absolute positioning:*it mean like normal but with scroll up and down*
**By using the float to place elements in page if we float item to left and the anthor item right it will appeare side-by-side we have 4type for float**
-*left*
-*right*
-*both*
-*none*
**In our web page we need to determine  the size of website to fit the screen because it is important to  display the resolutions that in css by using layout also we can use fixed width layouts all of this by grid**
**CSS Frameworks**:*the framework  it's code in css  provide rules for common tasks so it make life easier*
## JS
#### Functions, Methods, and Objects
###### Functions :
*the function set of series statement that do something according to the code when we calling that function*
**In JS we need to write a function  do 2 thing (Declaration function)and (calling the function)**
**Declaration function**: *by using Function name(arrgument) after it {here we coding the fun} or we can declare with write var function =() the two way for declaring same thing but different in how will run if we put calling before var function it will be error because the JS NOT LINE BY LINE it's running  first acroding to declaration the varible but*
**calling the function**: *by write the name of function and passing the data if the function need information*

###### Some note.
- *we can put multiple varible with value in the same function that mean we can use same function multi time*
-*The VARIABLE SCOPE* :*In scope the var call local it mean we can't used out of that scope of declartion and globel mean we declartion the var out of scope so we can used it any ware in code not like local*
