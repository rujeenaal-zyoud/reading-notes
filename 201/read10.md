# Error Handling & Debugging
**first of all what error mean?**
**error mean something wrong in our code may of mistake from Lack of attention or logical error by missing point in project code**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### There are two types of JavaScript error:

-Syntax Error: Occurs when there is a mistake in the way the code is written; for example, a typo or missing character.
-Runtime error: Occurs when the script is unable to complete its instructions; for example, if a specified object cannot be found.
**avaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error**

1-ORDER OF EXECUTION :*this mean order of statement it mean some methode depend in another varible or methode so the order is important to solve it the JS have EXECUT.ION CONTEXTS it message show by interputer the code in js*
2-XECUTION CONTEXT & HOISTING:*by having two PREPARE and EXECUTE this mean the varible in scope of code the interpreter in JS , each execution context has its own variables object.  Each execution context can also access its parent's v a ri ables object*
